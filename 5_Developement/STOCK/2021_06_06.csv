0,Week Ahead,"G7 finance ministers reached a historic agreement on Saturday to reform the global tax system ahead of the highly anticipated G7 leaders' summit on 11-13 June 2021. Elsewhere, monetary policy meetings in the Eurozone, Canada and Russia will be keenly watched, as well as updated GDP figures for Japan, the Eurozone, the UK and South Africa. Other important releases include US and China inflation and foreign trade data; US and Australia consumer sentiment; Germany and India industrial output; and Japan current account.


"
1,"TSX Closes Above 20,000 ","Canada’s main stock index has finished above the 20,000 level for the first time, as heavyweight commodity stocks lifted the index. Denison Mines Corp surged more than 6%, the most on the TSX, and the second biggest gainer was Nexgen Energy Ltd, up 5.2%. The risk-on sentiment was backed by another weaker-than-expected US payrolls number, which eased concerns about the economy running too hot and causing an early tightening of monetary policy. As a result, the S&P/TSX composite advanced nearly 1% this week, recording its third consecutive week of gains."
2,Wall Street Ends Volatile Week Higher,"All three main US stock indexes gained ground Friday to end a roller-coaster week higher, helped by technology shares, as weaker-than-expected jobs growth eased worries about an overheating economy. The US economy added 559K jobs in May, above an upwardly revised 278K in April but below market forecasts of 650K. Concerns that a robust economic rebound could lead to a prolonged period of inflation and prompt the Fed to consider paring back its crisis level support have spooked investors away from equities earlier this week. However, this latest reading of the job market cemented the Fed's narrative that the central bank will continue to remain ultra-accommodative until the economy has further recovered. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 advanced about 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, on the week for their second straight week of gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.5% this week for its third winning week in a row."
3,US Economy Adds Less Jobs than Expected ,"The US economy added 559K jobs in May of 2021, above an upwardly revised 278K in April but below market forecasts of 650K. That leaves employment about 7.6 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality (292K), in public (103K) and private education (41K), and in health care and social assistance (46K). Still, supply constraints, rising inflation and labor shortages are weighing on capacity production as many workers mostly women, remain at home and government subsidies may discourage some workers to find a job. As such, businesses have been struggling to rehire workers to cope with surging demand, prompting them to raise wages in a bid to attract new employees. Yet, hourly earnings surged 0.5%, above forecasts of 0.2%."
4,European Stocks End Week on High Note,"European stocks gained ground on Friday to end the week at record levels, with the benchmark DAX finishing above 15,700 for the first time, on growing expectations that the eurozone economy will begin rebounding at a faster pace in coming months as vaccination drives gather pace. Data earlier this week showing a solid expansion in European factory activity in May offered more evidence that the block could be recovering from a double-dip recession. On top of that, new US payrolls numbers pointed to a thinner than expected rise in American hiring last month, easing worries about the Federal Reserve reducing its massive support sooner than expected."
5,US Factory Orders Drop for 1st Time in 12 Months ,"Factory orders in the US shrank 0.6 percent month-over-month in April of 2021, the first decline in 12 months and more than market forecasts of a 0.2 percent fall. transportation equipment recorded the biggest decrease (-6.6 percent), namely ships and boats (-62.8 percent), defense aircraft and parts (-8.5 percent) and motor vehicles (-1.8 percent). Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components were also down (-0.7 percent). Excluding transportation, factory orders increased 0.5 percent. "
6,"Gold Rebounds, But Ends Week Lower","Gold rose more than 1% to around $1,890 an ounce on Friday, rebounding from an over 2-1/2-week low of $1,859 hit earlier in the session, in reaction to weaker-than-expected US jobs growth, which also pushed the dollar and Treasury yields sharply lower. The US economy added 559K jobs in May, below market expectations of a 650K, cementing the Fed's narrative that the central bank will continue to remain ultra-accommodative until the economy has further recovered. The precious metal has played a crucial role as an inflation-hedging asset as investors moved to price in a roaring comeback for the US economy and increased inflation. Still, the precious metal dropped approximately 0.6% this week, its largest weekly decline since March."
7,Bovespa Extends Record-Setting Rally,"Brazil’s main stock index climbed for the seventh straight session on Friday, with the benchmark Bovespa closing above 130,000 for the first time, driven by gains in the real estate and services sectors.  A weaker-than-expected US jobs report eased concerns that the Federal Reserve would start tightening monetary soon while still pointing to a solid recovery in the US labour market. On the data front, a PMI survey showed the Brazilian services sector shrank for the 5th straight month but the least in the current sequence amid a return to stability in new orders. The index advanced more than 3% this week, recording its third consecutive week of gains. "
8,WTI Crude Books Second Straight Weekly Gain,"Crude oil futures extended the weekly gain to almost 5% on Friday to trade above $69.4 a barrel for the first time since October 2018 and following a 4.3% gain in the previous week amid signs of strong post-pandemic economic recovery. On the supply side, API reported a fall of 5.36 million barrels in US stockpiles last week and EIA data showed a bigger-than-expected 5.08 million drop. Meanwhile, the Saudi Arabian energy minister said it would be premature to talk about potential overheating in the global oil market before seeing higher demand. Early this week, OPEC+ agreed to gradually ease supply curbs through July, signalling the ongoing strengthening of market fundamentals. "
9,Canada Jobless Rate Edges Up to 8.2% in May,"The unemployment rate in Canada increased to 8.2 percent in May of 2021 from 8.1 in the previous month, in line with market expectations. Employment fell by 68,000 (-0.4%), with almost all of the decline in part-time work (-54,000; -1.6%). The unemployment rate among visible minority Canadians aged 15 to 69 rose 1.5 percentage points to 11.4% (not seasonally adjusted). Long-term unemployment, the number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more, held relatively steady at 478,000. The labor force participation rate decreased to 64.6 percent from 64.9 percent in the previous month, the lowest since August 2020. Meantime, the youth unemployment rate fell to 15.9 percent in May from 16.1 percent in the previous month. "
