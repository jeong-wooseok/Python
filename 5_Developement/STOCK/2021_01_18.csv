The latest reading matched pre-pandemic levels with industrial output rising the most in 3-1/2 years in December. For full 2020, the GDP expanded 2.3%, the slowest pace in more than four decades. Still, China is likely to be the only major economy to avoid a contraction in 2020.

3,Oil Falls for 2nd Session,"WTI crude futures were lower for the 2nd session to $52 a barrel on Monday, the lowest level in near 2 weeks, amid concerns that surging COVID-19 globally could jeopardize the market’s recovery outlook. In China, over 28 million people are in lockdown as Beijing seeks to avoid a resurgence of the outbreak and in Europe infections continue to rise and countries tight restrictions.

4,Dollar at 5-Week High,"The dollar index extended gains for the 9th straight session to 90.9 on Monday, the highest level since December 11th and after posting its strongest weekly rise in 11 weeks.

On the political front, centrist Armin Laschet was elected as the new leader of Germany's center-right CDU, beating archconservative Friedrich Merz, 521 votes to 466. Laschet is likely to continue Angela Merkel's course, and the party might put him up as their chancellor candidate in September's general election.

6,Gold Attempts to Rebound,"Gold was slightly higher at $1834 an ounce on Monday, attempting to rebound from a 1% drop on Friday, although a stronger dollar prevented further gains. Investors continue to worry about rising coronavirus cases and the impact it will have on the global economy and lingering uncertainty and security concerns ahead of President-elect Joe Biden inauguration on Wednesday.
